# Introduction
The purpose of this app is to extract data from the FC2 log files generated by a Potensic PTD-1 drone controller and to convert them into a CSV file suitable for feeding into the [Telemetry Overlay](https://goprotelemetryextractor.com) application. Which lets me create heads-up displays that can be overlayed on video generated by a Potensic Atom-2 drone. 

Which, for a nerd like me, counts as fun.

## potdroneflightparser

This app would not exist if Koen Aerts and Rob Pitt hadn't already written the [potdroneflightparser](potdroneflightparser) - they did a great job but, sadly, have abandoned the project due to opposition from Potensic.  

# Development notes:

## Building:

The Toga code is just a skeleton and does nothing. There is no packaging
for the CLI tool right now, just run it from the directory.

To try and build the Toga package:

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ cd atomdataviewer
$ briefcase build
```

## Briefcase & Toga:
https://beeware.org/

## Telemetry Overlay Documentation:
TO isn't exactly rushing to provide documentation, either, but they do have a bit on how the CSV file should be formatted in the [Telemetry Overlay Manual](https://goprotelemetryextractor.com/docs/telemetry-overlay-manual.pdf)

## FC2 data file format:
1. Potensic doesn't want people reverse engineering the log file formats for their drones.
2. koen-aerts, who wrote the potdroneflightparser, originally reverse-engineered the file formats for the original Atom, Atom SE and earlier firmware versions of the Atom 2. He doesn't know what to do with the Atom2's FPV files. Says they are "optional".
3. Unfortunately, the FC2 file format appears to have changed since he did his work. Enough fields were still correct to give me a serious leg up. I'm very grateful to him and to Rob for doing it, I probably would have gotten frustrated and given up if they hadn't shown me where to start! 
4. The file name is a reasonably accurate time stamp (unlike the names of the video files). The video files contain no meta data at all, not even time stamps.
5. Each record of an FC2 file is 512 bytes long and begins with a record id. (See below.)
6. Records appear to be packed with little regard to word-alignment.
7. I'm reasonably sure the data in the FC2 file is partly generated by the PTD-1. The record format is definitely not set in stone. Firmware updates to the PTD-1 may change it.
8. It is possible the record format is different between the PTD-1 and what is generated by the Potensic Eve phone app (used when using the older style controller).

## FC2 Record format:
Fields are all little-endian.
"Correct" indicates that I know for sure that the field is valid.
| Byte: | Length: | Format: | Description: | Correct: |
|-------|---------|---------|--------------|----------|
| 0 | 4 | integer | Record Id | Yes |
| 4 | 1 | byte | always zero. ||
| 5 | 8 | long long | ms since the drone started(?) or possibly since the PTD-1 started(?) Can be combined with the file name to generate time stamps for each record, which TO can use. | Yes |
| 13 | 2 | short | Starts as zero but occasionally changes to one of a few distinct values. Observed values are 0, 25, 30, 35, 40, 120. Initially zero, goes to a non-zero value very early in the log. May occasionally change during flight.||
| 15 | 2 | short | Starts as zero but then may change to a value that will match field 13. ||
| 17 | 2 | ushort | How many times the drone has flown? Increments with each take off. Slightly more than what the PTD-1 reports. | Yes |
| 19 | 26 | ??? | Unknown. Values appear to change frequently. | |
